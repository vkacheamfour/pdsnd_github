### Project Title
BIKESHARE

### Description
This is part of Udacity Python foundation course that uses knowledge of Python's modules- Pandas and Numpy, to make sense of the bike sharing data provided, and answer relevant questions about it.

### Files used
This repository contains-

    Three csv files with data for three cities- chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv.
    One python file written to assess the data in the csv files- bikeshare.py.

To use the project-

    Place the bikeshare.py file and all the CSV files in the same folder.
    Run the python file using a suitable python interpreter.


### Credits
To complete the project, I used my knowledge which I gained over the course of studying the Python Foundation Nanodegree Program on Udacity. If I got stuck some place, the source(s) below helped me-

    Stackoverflow
    Python documentation
    Tutorials Point
    Pandas Documentation
    I used Jupyter Notebook extensively for quickly running small snippets of code, and Atom editor for bigger pieces of code.
